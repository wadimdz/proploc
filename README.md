## proploc - Java properties l10n tool

Extracts new/changed messages from language properties basing on 
master properties files which were updated by developers. Extracted messages can be sent to
translators and later reintegrated in sources.

## Example
Precondition: master property files have no language suffix (for example: mytexts.properties) 
and properties files with other languages have one (for example: mytexts_pl.properties).

### Extracting
If You have two directories with properties from previous (RelX) and current (RelY) release:

```
java -jar proploc.jar -totr RelX RelY
```

would produce a set of files named "UNTRANSLATED_<original_filename>_<lang_code>.properties" containing properties from <original_filename>.properties which have no translation in language-specific properties file or the master text was changed between RelX and RelY.

### Integration
When translations are done, then put them in a directory (with "<original_filename>_<lang_code>.properties" names) and run:

```
java -jar proploc.jar -integrate RelY translations RelYnew
```

Then the "RelYnew" directory will contain property files which use strings from translated files found in "translations" directory.
